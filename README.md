### README for Zen Note Journal Web Application

# Zen Note

**Zen Note** is an interactive journal web application that allows users to record their daily learnings in a visually appealing and easy-to-use platform. It features a professional design with light and dark modes, glassmorphism effects, and emoji-driven actions. Users can add, view, and delete learnings, and even generate beautiful snapshots of their entries with the option to download or copy them.

---

## Features

1. **Daily Learnings Entry**:
   - Users can enter their daily learnings.
   - Learnings are displayed date-wise, with the latest entries shown at the top.
   - Only one date heading per day is displayed, under which all the learnings of that day are listed.

2. **Delete Functionality**:
   - Instead of a "delete" button, a bin emoji üóëÔ∏è is displayed for each entry. Clicking it asks for confirmation before deleting the entry.

3. **Snapshot Creation**:
   - Next to each entry, a snapshot emoji üì∑ allows users to generate a visual snapshot of their learning.
   - Snapshots include the date, entry, and the app's name, with a glowing effect to promote the app.
   - Users can either download or copy the generated snapshot.

4. **Dark Mode**:
   - The application includes a dark mode toggle (üåô/‚òÄÔ∏è). Both the main interface and snapshots adapt to light and dark modes.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

6. **Storage**:
   - Entries are saved using `localStorage` so users can retrieve their previous learnings even after refreshing or closing the page.
